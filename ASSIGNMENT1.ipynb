Its significance lies in its ability to create products that are not only usable, but also useful and meaningful to users.\n",

        "  -  Usability testing is a key method in improving user experience (UX) by evaluating how real users interact with a product or prototype. It helps identify pain points, confusing elements, and areas for improvement—based on actual behavior, not assumptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Here’s the role usability testing plays in enhancing UX:\n",
        "\n",
        "   1. Validates Design Decisions\n",
        "    - Designers can confirm whether navigation, layout, and interactions are intuitive and effective.\n",

        "   2. Identifies Usability Issues Early\n",
        "    - Catching problems early in the design or development phase is faster and cheaper to fix.\n",
        "  \n",
        "   3. Reveals Real User Behavior\n",
        "   - Users often behave differently than expected. Testing uncovers how they actually think, click, and move through an interface.\n",
        "   \n",
        "    4. Improves Efficiency and Satisfaction\n",
        "   -  Testing helps refine workflows so users can complete tasks faster and with fewer errors.\n",
        "    5. Supports Data-Driven Design\n",
        "   - Feedback and metrics gathered during testing (e.g., task completion rates, error rates, satisfaction scores) guide objective design improvements.\n",
        "    6. Encourages Iteration\n",
        "   -  Usability testing is often conducted in multiple rounds to continuously refine the product.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Legal Compliance\n",
        "  - Many regions have laws and regulations (like WCAG, ADA, and Section 508) that require accessible digital experiences.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Inaccessible designs can lead to lawsuits, fines, or legal action.\n",

        "   - Over 1 billion people globally have some form of disability.\n",

        "  - Features like keyboard navigation, clear labels, and readable text help everyone, not just users with disabilities.\n",
